### Description

Hi All

This is a little MYSQL ADMIN project i worked on, but never got around to make done, so I thought I share it with you people.

I was going for something like TOAD for oracle, if anyone knows that program, but It's only 50% done.

You going to need the ODBC driver. You can download the MyODBC-3.51.06.exe at

http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/odbc/

Hope you enjoy the program.
